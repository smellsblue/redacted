Redacted is a Chrome plugin to redact the message text for incoming
desktop notifications for GMail (and chat from within GMail).

If you like notifications, but dislike eavesdroppers from seeing the
messages, feel free to
[download](https://github.com/mikestone/redacted/raw/master/redacted.crx)
the binary file and install it in Chrome.

If you like this plugin, please check out my comic:
